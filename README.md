## Project Overview
#### GeoSeek aims to be the name for creating engaging experiences through technology while promoting community engagement and physical activity.

GeoSeek allows you to place and find user-created and curated hidden gems within your local community.
 
Search the map for gems close to you. Travel to the location and see the amazing features of that location!
 
Know of someplace great?  Maybe a breathtaking view at sunset or a part of your town thatâ€™s a little less travelled but holds great historical significance! Whatever and wherever the case, create your hidden gem and share it with others!
